                        <p>When I was just a kid, I was so curious about how computers and technologies work, what makes computers do things, but didn't have a computer till I was 12 years old.</p>
                        <p> I really liked videogames! And actually, you could see me play games for hours straight. Later on, I discovered that you can make computers do things and make games of you're own.</p>
                        <p>And the next thing you know is that you're doing side projects on Fiverr and enroll at CS50, which changes your life. Looking curiously into the future!</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I remember my first thought about programming - how can anybody understand it, it looks so complicated. At the time, I didn't think that it will lead me to something bigger than simple "Hello, world", but I tried.</p>
                        <p>I have this clear memory in my head, I am watching my first programming tutorial on YouTube (and it happened to be a Ruby tutorial) and I understand absolute 0, literally 0. I just repeat keystroke after keystore what video host says me to repeat.</p>
                        <p>I can guess I made simple "Hello, world!" type program with simple if statements and I think "It's so complicated but so fascinating, I am making a computer do things."</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>By the time I came across web development, I really liked making small programs, but I missed seeing things I make visually. Because Ruby is a proper programming language, its output is text-based and objectively it feels less rewarding than visual stuff.</p>
                        <p>Then one day, I came across web development. I really liked making <a href="https://kovels.netlify.app/">simple websites</a>, because it gave me that missing feeling of seeing progress. On the other hand, CSS was the most frustrating stuff you could imagine. All those classes and ids, something not working properly, etc., was unbearably frustrating.</p>

                        <p>It's been two years since I programmed something, at that point I was unmotivated and didn't want to do anything related to programming. One side of me was still trying to motivate me to program something but an unmotivated part overtook me.</p>
                        <p>One of the reasons why I was so unmotivated was that I needed to find all information by myself, and all of those little pieces of information were a little bit different one from another. And I gotta say, it's hard to learn by myself. It becomes so much easier to learn when there is someone who can help you get through.</p>

                        <p>It's been two years since I programmed something and I started losing motivation till one day I came across Python learning program on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. It caught my eye from first sight, it not only gave me learning material but also gave me tasks where I can apply newly learned information.</p>
                        <p>I enjoyed Python so much, it was syntactically so much easier than other programming languages. I felt like I was eager to learn as much as I can get from this website. It was so much fun. I had all the support I need which I didn't have when I was studying by myself.</p>

                        <h5>School days, September 2018</h5>

                        </div>
                        <p>When I started my sophomore year in a new school, I had a new class - Introduction to programming, where they happened to teach Python. As I already knew the basics of Python it was easier to study in this class where everyone else thought Python is a snake more than a proper programming language.</p>
                        <p>In my school we had to do the paper in terms of two years. In the first year, you should do the theoretical part of the paper, whereas in the second year there should be the practical part of the paper. You could try to guess in which subject I chose to do my paper.</p>
                        <p>I chose to research Game Development using Python and its library Pygame. A year later I made my first game, I was so excited about it, I loved the process of making my own game, which later allowed me to make money by making simple games. I got 10 (on a scale of 1-10) for this paper. </p>
                        <br>

                        <h5>First paycheck, April 7, 2020</h5>

                        </div>
                        <p>I always had a thought in my head "How can I monetize my knowledge" because I already had some experience developing games why couldn't I make some money doing it. I chose Fiverr. The first day I posted my Gig I already had my first order.</p>
                        <p>Person ordered a simple 2D tank game and I thought "Oh, this should be easy". It wasn't easy at all. I had so much anxiety because it was my first order and I need to complete it in time and of good quality. It didn't go so well, still, I figured out how to deliver it in time. That was a greatly valuable experience.</p>
                        <p>Since then I have had delivered some more orders. Buyers were satisfied and grateful. I made a few bucks and gained incredible experience. And by the way, you can check out my page <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/vairiskovels/make-you-the-best-2d-game-using-pygame">here</a>.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Then I was confident about what I want to do in life. I want to develop, to solve problems. And one day I saw the post on Instagram, that they are making a competition for a spot in the free PHP program. So I took a chance and applied.</p>
                        <p>The first task was something like describe yourself, why do you want to participate. Nothing complicated. The second task was to make a simple website with the implementation of a to-do list. That was the first time I encountered PHP. And I gotta say, that was the most cryptic language I've ever seen. I worked on this page day and night.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, I didn't proceed to the next round. However, it gave me a useful experience.</p>

                        <p>Since Codecademy's times I haven't had any support in my learning process. That's until I came across CS50, Harvard, and Yale's Introduction to Computer Science course.</p>
                        <p>It's December 30th and suddenly I get so excited about this program but I don't want to start this program immediately because... well there is no specific reason, I just felt like I want to start it in the new year. And that's so how it all started. Now I am on week 8 doing this project and looking forward to the next step of my journey.</p>

                        <p>Okay, not Harvard Harvard, but I've finished CS50 - IMO best introductory course for software engineers. I've spent countless hours watching lectures, participating in labs, and making my project.</p>
                        <p>As a final project I chose to develop an expense tracking web application. You can access it <a href="https://log-it-app.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. I am so proud of this creation, the amount of time and hard work I spent working on this project is immeasurable.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to all CS50's staff and David J. Malan who inspired me to keep moving forward despite wanting to give up.</p>
